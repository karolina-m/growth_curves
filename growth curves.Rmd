# Variables:

# vocab_score - overall vocab - total number of words child produces, range: 0 - 670
# alternatives - overall gram - total score from alternative sentences, measures complexity of child's sentences

# verb_person - child's score on inflection of verbs by persons, range: 0-6
# verb_tense - child's score on inflection of verbs by tense, range: 0-3
# verbs - because the two above have such narrow score ranges, this is a summed verbs score: verb_person + verb_tense.

# noun_form - child's score on inflection of nouns by cases, range 0-10
# noun_context - also measuring inflection of nouns by cases, but in a different way: by producing a full sentence (with context) and asking parent whether child says sth like that; range 0 - 9
# nouns -  this is a summed nouns score: noun_form + noun_context to mirror the approach for verbs; however, this may not have been the best idea, as the two measures essentially ask the same question.

# adjective_adverb - child's score on the inflection of adjectives and adverbs (comparison, e.g. tall, taller, tallest), range 0-4

# vocabulary subscales:
# action words - how many verbs does the child know, range from 0 to 123
# connceting words - how many connecting words does the child know, range from 0 to 9
