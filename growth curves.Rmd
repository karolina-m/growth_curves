# Variables:

# vocab_score - overall vocab - total number of words child produces, range: 0 - 670
# alternatives - overall gram - total score from alternative sentences, measures complexity of child's sentences

# verb_person - child's score on inflection of verbs by persons, range: 0-6
# verb_tense - child's score on inflection of verbs by tense, range: 0-3
# verbs - because the two above have such narrow score ranges, this is a summed verbs score: verb_person + verb_tense.

# noun_form - child's score on inflection of nouns by cases, range 0-10
# noun_context - also measuring inflection of nouns by cases, but in a different way: by producing a full sentence (with context) and asking parent whether child says sth like that; range 0 - 9
# nouns -  this is a summed nouns score: noun_form + noun_context to mirror the approach for verbs; however, this may not have been the best idea, as the two measures essentially ask the same question.

# adjective_adverb - child's score on the inflection of adjectives and adverbs (comparison, e.g. tall, taller, tallest), range 0-4

# vocabulary subscales:
# action words - how many verbs does the child know, range from 0 to 123
# connceting words - how many connecting words does the child know, range from 0 to 9

Exploring growth of vocab (overall) and grammar (overall).
T1 ~ 18 mo, T2 ~ 24 mo, T3 ~ 30 mo.
Vocab growth seems not that linear, it could be a mock artefact but it has been reported before.
Note the wide CI error bars (my guess in real data the variability may be even greater).

```{r}
# vocab (overall)
ggplot(summarySE(mock_n50, measurevar = "vocab_score", groupvars = "timepoint"), 
       aes(x = timepoint, y = vocab_score, group = 1)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = vocab_score - ci, ymax = vocab_score + ci), width = 0.1) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() 

# grammar (overall), i.e., alternatives
ggplot(summarySE(mock_n50, measurevar = "alternatives", groupvars = "timepoint"), 
       aes(x = timepoint, y = alternatives, group = 1)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = alternatives - ci, ymax = alternatives + ci), width = 0.1) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() 
```

# vocab growth - mixed linear reg
# linear for now, but vocab growth may be NON-linear

# only random intercept for child for start
m0 <- lmer(vocab_score ~ 1 + (1|id), data = mock_n50)
m1 <- lmer(vocab_score ~ timepoint + (1|id), data = mock_n50)
m2 <- lmer(vocab_score ~ timepoint + alternatives + (1|id), data = mock_n50)

anova(m0, m1, m2)
AIC(m0, m1, m2)
BIC(m0, m1, m2)

summary(m2)
# timepoints effect - yes - vocab increases between T1 and T3 (but not much between T1 and T2) - note non-linearity visible in plot above
# grammar effect - yes - quite strong (t > 4)
# random effects - yes - substantial variability between kids
# moderate correlations between T2 and T3
